The combined likelihood algorithm views propagation trees as logic trees. Vertical lines are mathematically represented by $\cup$, while horizontal lines are represented by $\cap$. For each tree, the And/Or summation begins at the bottom, farthest from the instigating subsystem. Through a combination of And and Or evaluations, a single combined likelihood value can be computed at the top of the tree. Since the events are not mutually exclusive the summations take the form:

*And* function as a product of probabilities:

$l_{b,u} \cup l_{b,v} = l_{b,u} \times l_{b,v}$

*Or* function as a sum of probabilities minus the product term (the inverse of the product of inverse probabilities):

$l_{b,u} \cap l_{b,v} = l_{b,u} + l_{b,v} - (l_{b,u} \times l_{b,v}) = 1 - ((1 - l_{b,u}) \times (1 - l_{b,v}))$
